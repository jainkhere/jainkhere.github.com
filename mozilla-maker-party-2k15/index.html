            <p>You know, what is good about Mozilla Community? <br>
They never say <strong>NO</strong>!!! <br>
You want to contribute, yes. You want to develop, yes. You want to join, a yes surely. Their openness is the thing which everyone likes about them. <br>
And what else day could you choose to promote Mozilla community, other than Software Freedom Day.</p>

<p>So the stage was set for <em>the</em> Biggest Software Freedom Day Celebration of the North India at none other than National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur(H.P) on the 19th of September and the key event of the celebration was <strong>Mozilla Maker Party</strong>. The event, mainly comprising of the Freshers of the campus, was awesome and fun, just what maker party should be.Audience was initially unknown to world of Mozilla but when they left the event I am sure they left with quite an experience. When Varun Kalra,our college's Firefox Student Ambassador, initially asked audience if they knew what Mozilla was, only few among them really could tell what it was, but in the end everyone of them was willing to contribute to the community in one way or other. They learned how to make apps, the easy way, using <strong>app maker</strong> and were simply awe struck when introduced to the <strong>x-ray googles</strong>. What got audience most excited were Mozilla schwags and when students were showing and sharing their schwags with friends, the atmosphere was inspiring as a new generation was now part of The Mozilla Community.</p>

<h2 id="whatabouttheconclusion">What about the Conclusion?</h2>

<p>The Party isn't over yet. Students have shown keen interest in Web Maker tools and as I am writing this blog, might be possible that some students in the campus are busy making some awesome stuff using those tools. A tool like Web Maker is <em>the</em> next big thing in development and I hope that Mozilla will keep creating such wonderful applications to develop the web, <strong>for the people and by the people</strong>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the next Mozilla Event...</p>
